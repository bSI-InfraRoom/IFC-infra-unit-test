### Intent

This scenario creates IfcSolidStratum for two small tins to be used as the top and bottom surfaces in the following Earthworks-12d Unit Tests.
The two surfaces do not totally overlap each other.

The figure shows:

- plan view of top tin (magenta) and bottom tin (brown) and string lines used for sectioning
- perspective view of top and bottom tins
- section view (0.2 exaggeration) of section through the two tins along the two-point string line "section 1" (white colour)
- section view (0.2 exaggeration) of section through the two tins along the two-point string line section 2" (white colour) 
- long section view (0.2 exaggeration) of section through the two tins along the three-point string line "section 3" (cylan colour)
