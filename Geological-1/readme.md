### Intent

This UT demonstrates representation of Geological feature identification as a part of the EIC Activities / Transport for New South Wales storyline (Theoretical Infrastructure Project in Sydney).  It's an extract (overall model is too large for github) of two layers from data generated by Seequent software.  The data set was authored in IFC4 from Seequent who are progressing an IFC4.3 implementation.  The file was "upgraded" by Geometry Gym to demonstrate/test IFC4.3 improvements.

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:

- Spatial structure and containment
    - `IfcSite`
- Physical elements 
    - `IfcSolidStratum`
        - `Pset_GeotechnicalStratumCommon`
- Other    
    - `IfcClassification`
