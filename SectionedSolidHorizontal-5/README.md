### Intent

This scenario allows testing of a sectioned swept area solid. It uses a profile that changes in the first section, then has a constant section and then goes back to the same profile as the start.

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the alignment semantic and geometry definition.

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:

- IfcAlignment
- IfcAlignmentSegment
- IfcAlignmentHorizontal
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment
- IfcLine
- IfcCircle
- IfcClothoid
- IfcCompositeCurve
- IfcAlignmentVertical
- IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment
- IfcGradientCurve
- IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal
- IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef
- IfcIndexedPolyCurve
- IfcDerivedProfileDef
