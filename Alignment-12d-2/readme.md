### Intent

This scenario has the IFC semantic definition of an alignment with:

Civil Horizontal:

- horizontal straight
- horizontal arc with IFC positive radius of curvature
- horizontal straight

Civil Vertical:

- vertical straight
- vertical crest arc
- vertical straight

There is no IFC geometry.

![alignment12d2](../Alignment-12d-2/Alignment-12d-2.png  "Alignment with horizontal straight-arc-straight and vertical straight, crest arc and vertical straight") 

The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

- Alignment-12d-1

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- `IfcAlignmentVertical`
- `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` with `PredefinedType=CONSTANTGRADIENT`
- `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` with `PredefinedType=CIRCULARARC` for a crest
