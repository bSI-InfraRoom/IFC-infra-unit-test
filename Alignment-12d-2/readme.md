### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment with left arc in horizontal geometry and a crest arc for vertical geometry
That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):

- straight
- an arc with IFC positive radius of curvature
- a straight

Civil Vertical Geometry (VG):

- straight
- a crest arc
- a straight

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.
The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

- UT-Alignment-12d-1

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- `IfcAlignmentVertical`
- `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` with `PredefinedType=CONSTANTGRADIENT`
- `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` with `PredefinedType=CIRCULARARC` for a crest

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:
