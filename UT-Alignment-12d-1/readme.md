### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment with left arc in horizontal and no vertical.

That is it has Civil Horizontal Geometry (HG):
- straight
- an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature
- a straight

In the ifc file there is only the ifc semantic definition of the alignment and no ifc geometry.
The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

- ProjectSetup-1

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- 'IfcAlignment'                  - fudged 'Axis' as there is no Ifc geometry
- 'IfcAlignmentHorizontal'
- 'IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment' with 'PredefinedType=LINE'
- 'IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment' with 'PredefinedType=CIRCULARARC' for a left arc

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:
