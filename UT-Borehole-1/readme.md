### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC3
This scenario tests the concepts to represent a borehole investigation.
The basis data digitized into IFC is found as a TMR (Queensland) sample borehole here:
https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/-/media/busind/techstdpubs/Geotechnical/Geotech-Borehole-Logging/Geotechnical-Borehole-Logging.pdf?la=en

It was used as the basis of a live coding demonstration of generating Unit Tests of IFC4x3 extension,
the recording is available here: https://app.box.com/folder/125960920472?s=8l3htcavn1h2gx1e78kh4pij6iwa8dyu

The c# code to generate this unit test can be found here: https://github.com/GeometryGym/IFCInfraOpenCoding/tree/master/201020%20Webinar
