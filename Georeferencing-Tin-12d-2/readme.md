### Intent

This scenario has a TIN with coordinates for `IfcTriangulatedIrregularNetwork` in map metres
 but using a local origin of (256400.0, 7011600.0, 0.0) to truncate the coordinates.
IfcMapConversion is used to translate data to the correct (Easting, Northing, Height) for the map projection.
The data is already in map metres so Scale, ScaleY and ScaleZ are 1.
The Horizontal and Vertical datums are specified in `IfcProjectedCRS`.

The TIN has one colour for all the triangles and there are no voids in the TIN.

Special note: the data is *NOT* in local engineering coordinates.
The units for *x* and *y* are map metres and not ground metres.

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the other scenarios:

- Georeferencing-Tin-12d-1

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- `IfcMapConversion` is used to translate the data from truncated map coordinates (a local origin) to map coordinates.
