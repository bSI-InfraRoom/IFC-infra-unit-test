### Intent

The scenario is of a typical alignment from a real project.
The alignment has a 2D length of 33,876.059 Km and a non-zero start chainage of 111,146.9996. 

- the alignment includes:
     horizontal alignment: straights, IFC clothoids and arcs
	 horizontal alignment: start chainage of 111146.9996
     vertical alignment:   straights and parabolas

The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios:

- Georeferencing-1
- Alignment-12d-8
- Alignment-12d-9
 
### Content

This example demonstrates a typical alignment for a road project.
