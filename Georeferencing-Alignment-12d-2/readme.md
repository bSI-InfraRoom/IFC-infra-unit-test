### Intent

The scenario is of typical alignments from a real project for a grade separated highway.
The alignment RS1A has a 2D length of 33,876.059 Km and a non-zero start chainage of 111,146.9996. 
The alignment RS2A has a 2D length of 33,869.361 Km and a non-zero start chainage of -53. 

- the alignment RS1A includes:
     horizontal alignment: straights, IFC clothoids and arcs
	 horizontal alignment: start chainage of 111146.9996
     vertical alignment:   straights and parabolas

- the alignment RS2A includes:
     horizontal alignment: straights, IFC clothoids and arcs
	 horizontal alignment: start chainage of -53
     vertical alignment:   straights and parabolas
